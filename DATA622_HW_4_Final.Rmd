# Overview

# Load Data

We will first load in the data that is required for this analysis. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
url_git<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitableGabe/Data624_Data/main/Underlying%20Cause%20of%20Death%2C%202018-2022%2C%20Single%20Race.txt"
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
cdc_ucd_df <- as_tibble(read_tsv(url_git,
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)
                        )%>%
                          dplyr::select(-1)%>%
                          rename(Race = `Single Race 6`,
                                 `Race Code` = `Single Race 6 Code`)



```

# Exporatory Analysis (EDA)

First, we can preview our dataset. 

```{r}
glimpse(cdc_ucd_df)
```

The dataset consists of 5,905 rows and 11 columns. Most of the variables are categorical, except for the "Deaths" column indicating the count for this type of observation. 

We can take also take a look at the summary statistics for each of the numeric variables. 

```{r}
describe(cdc_ucd_df)
```

```{r}
summary(cdc_ucd_df)
```


```{r}
apply(cdc_ucd_df, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```


### NA Proportions

We can view if any variable is without NAs below

```{r}
data.frame(missing = colSums(is.na(cdc_ucd_df))) |>
  filter(missing == 0) |>
  rownames()
```

Considering all values have 66 NA, it is important to understand how much this would impact the overall data.

```{r}
plot_missing(cdc_ucd_df, 
             missing_only = T,
             ggtheme = theme_classic(),
             theme_config = list(legend.position = c("right")),
             geom_label_args = list("size" = 3, "label.padding" = unit(0.1, "lines")))
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
VIM::aggr(cdc_ucd_df, numbers=T, sortVars=T, bars = FALSE,
          cex.axis = .6)
```

We can see that all 11 variables is missing 1.12% of values, which means the NA count of 66 observations noted from the summary is not of great concern, therefore I will actively make the decision to remove it.

```{r}
cdc_ucd_df<-na.omit(cdc_ucd_df)
```


```{r}
# kable(cdc_ucd_df$`Cause of death`, format = "html", row.names = TRUE) %>%
#   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```


### Distributions

We will now take a look at the distributions of the numeric variables. 

```{r}
DataExplorer::plot_histogram(cdc_ucd_df, nrow = 4L, ncol = 4L, ggtheme = theme_classic())
```

It appears neither numeric values `County Code` or `Deaths` is normally distributed 

```{r}
# Create bar plot for gender distribution
ggplot(cdc_ucd_df, aes(x = Gender, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution", x = "Gender", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Change the theme to minimal
  theme(legend.position = "none") +  # Remove legend
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Male" = "skyblue",
                               "Female" = "pink"))  # Custom fill colors
  

# Create bar plot for race distribution
ggplot(cdc_ucd_df, aes(x = str_wrap(`Race`, width = 10),
                                    fill = `Race`)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Race Distribution", x = "Race", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Change the theme to minimal
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1)) +  # Remove legend
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Asian" = "lightgreen",
                               "Black" = "lightblue",
                               "White" = "lightcoral"))  # Custom fill colors

```

It also appears that deaths among men are higher than women, and among races, more deaths occurred for individuals classified as "white".




```{r, fig.height=9}
# Calculate frequency of each cause of death
top_10_ca_freq<- table(cdc_ucd_df$`Cause of death`)

# Select the top 10 causes of death
top_10_ca <- names(sort(top_10_ca_freq, decreasing = TRUE))[1:10]

# Filter data to include only the top 10 causes of death
top_10_ca_data <- subset(cdc_ucd_df, `Cause of death` %in% top_10_ca)

# Create the plot with sorted values
ggplot(top_10_ca_data, aes(x = reorder(str_wrap(`Cause of death`, width = 23), -table(`Cause of death`)[`Cause of death`]), fill = `Cause of death`)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Causes of Death", x = "Cause", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Change the theme to minimal
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)) +   # Rotate x-axis labels by 45 degrees
  coord_flip()

```

My main concern with the data is the most prominent causes of death in NYC so above I identified the top 10 for 2018-2022. Not surprisingly Covid-19 ranked as #1.

```{r}
# Calculate frequency of each cause of death by race
ca_freq_rc <- table(cdc_ucd_df$Race, cdc_ucd_df$`Cause of death`,
                    cdc_ucd_df$Gender)

# Convert the frequency table to a data frame
ca_freq_rc_df <- as.data.frame.table(ca_freq_rc)

# Rename columns
names(ca_freq_rc_df) <- c("Race", "Cause","Gender", "Frequency")

# Sort by frequency in descending order
ca_freq_rc_df <- 
  ca_freq_rc_df[order(ca_freq_rc_df$Frequency,
                             decreasing = TRUE),]
```


```{r,fig.height=8}

# Filter to keep only the top 3 causes of death for each race
top_3_causes <- do.call(rbind,
                        lapply(split(ca_freq_rc_df,
                                     ca_freq_rc_df$Race),
                               function(x) head(x, 3)))
top_3_causes_m <- subset(top_3_causes, Gender == "Male")
top_3_causes_f <- subset(top_3_causes, Gender == "Female")


# Create the plot for males
ggplot(top_3_causes_m, aes(x = Race, y = Frequency, fill = Cause)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Top 3 Causes of Death by Race", x = "Race", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +  # Position the legend at the bottom
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+  
  # Manually wrap legend labels
  coord_flip()

# Create the plot for females
ggplot(top_3_causes_f, aes(x = Race, y = Frequency, fill = Cause)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Top 3 Causes of Death by Race", x = "Race", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +  # Position the legend at the bottom
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+  
  # Manually wrap legend labels
  coord_flip()

```

```{r}
# Define a function to map race descriptions to numeric codes
race_to_numeric <- function(race) {
  race <- tolower(race)  # Convert to lowercase for case insensitivity

  # Mapping races to numeric codes
  race_code <- case_when(
    grepl("american indian|alaska native", race) ~ 1,
    grepl("asian", race) ~ 2,
    grepl("black|african american", race) ~ 3,
    grepl("native hawaiian|other pacific islander", race) ~ 4,
    grepl("white|other", race) ~ 5,
    TRUE ~ NA_integer_  # Handle other cases
  )

  return(race_code)
}

# Add a new column "Race Code Numeric" based on the mapping
cdc_ucd_df$Race_Code_Numeric <- sapply(cdc_ucd_df$Race, race_to_numeric)

# Display the updated data frame
head(cdc_ucd_df)

First I need to remove Zero-Variance data, and since the data is specifically from New York State, `State` and `State Code` is removed.

```{r}
cdc_model<-cdc_ucd_df%>%
                dplyr::select(-c(State,`State Code`))
```

From here, the mutliple classifications are set with `as.factor` and `Gender Code` is simple set to character. From there we preprocess the data, and use `predict()` for our model.

```{r}
cdc_model <- cdc_model %>%
  mutate(
    County = as.factor(`County`),
    Gender = as.factor(Gender),
    Race = as.factor(Race),
    `Cause of death` = as.factor(`Cause of death`),
    `Gender Code` = as.character(`Gender Code`)
  ) %>%
  predict(preProcess(., method = c("center", "scale")), .) 
```


```{r}
set.seed(321)

# cdc_train <- cdc_model$Deaths%>%
#   createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
# df_train_cdc  <- df_1k_num[cdc_train, ]
# df_test_cdc <- df_1k_num[-cdc_train, ]
# 
# 
# model<- lm(Total.Revenue~., data=df_train_1k )
# 
# vif_values<-car::vif(model)

# print(vif_values)
```
